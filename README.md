# An Intelligence Approach to Detect Plant Disease.

### Project Summary:
Designed a model to create a model for any plant’s categorical disease from its leaf. And build a simple interface to test that model against some plant leaf.

### Operations:
- Collected affected and unaffected vegetable leaf from a hybrid vegetable research center.
- Sorted and organized those leaf as useable dataset by using manual tools – Adobe Photoshop CC.
- Designed a model based on vgg19 pretrained model for the dataset
- Test the generated model with the interface.
