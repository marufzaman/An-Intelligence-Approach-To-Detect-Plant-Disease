# An Intelligence Approach to Detect Plant Disease.

### Project Summary:
Designed a model to create a model for any plant’s categorical disease from its leaf. And build a simple interface to test that model against some plants leaf.

### Operations:
- Collected affected and unaffected vegetable leaf from a Hybrid Vegetable Research Centre.
- Sorted and organized those leaf as a usable dataset by using manual tools — Adobe Photoshop CC.
- Designed a model based on the vgg19 pre-trained model for the dataset.
- Test the generated model with the interface.
